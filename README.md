## Project Overview

The universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old, while the Earth has only been around for 4.54 billion years. As the universe continues to expand, questions remain about how galaxies formed and evolved. To solve this puzzle of the cosmic structure, understanding the distribution and types of galaxies as a function of their shapes and sizes is crucial. As the technology, specifically telescopes, for capturing such phenomena and returning images to scientists on Earth, improves, the dataset increases exponentially. Traditionally, galaxy identifications were achieved by crowdsourcing. However, as the datasets grow to the scale of hundreds of millions of galaxies, manual identification becomes less feasible. This project aims to analyze photos of galaxies and to train an algorithm that generates automated metrics and classifies them into two different classes, spiral and elliptical. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), and other machine learning methods such as ridge regression and random forest are used in the analysis.
